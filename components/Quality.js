            {`To find the materials worthy of your NFT, we took the time to unroll
            miles of fabric searching for the optimum feel. There are plenty of
            options, but it’s really hard to beat organic Pima Cotton from Peru.
            We’ve partnered with a manufacturer in the USA who cuts and sews
            each piece by hand. It’s then imbued with your NFT. We’ve spared no
            detail down to the thread and leveled up at each step of the
            process. Some details you’ll notice right out of the box and others
            in 6.9 years. Both you and your eluno will continue to improve with
            age.`}
